  HOW TO FIX "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" ERROR
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
You're seeing "localhost refused to connect" because the backend is not running.

SOLUTION:
1. Double-click this file: START_BACKEND_NOW.bat
   (It's in the same folder as this file)
   
2. A NEW WINDOW WILL OPEN - this is the backend server
   DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW!
   
3. Wait for this message in the window:
   "Started LearningManagementSystemApplication"
   
   This takes 30-60 seconds on first run.
   
4. Once you see that message, test the backend:
   Open in browser: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
   
   Should see: {"status":"UP"}
   
5. Refresh your login page:
   http://localhost:3000/instructor
   
6. The network error should be GONE!

IMPORTANT:
- Keep the backend window OPEN while using the app
- If you close it, the backend stops and you'll get the error again
- Backend must stay running for frontend to work

TEST CREDENTIALS:
- Instructor: instructor@gmail.com / instructor2468
- Admin: admin@gmail.com / admin2468

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If backend won't start:
1. Check Java is installed: java -version
2. Check MySQL is running: netstat -ano | findstr :3306
3. Look at the backend window for error messages

If still not working:
1. Check the backend window for red error messages
2. Make sure MySQL is running
3. Verify Java is at: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21
